# Preparation

Get ready to reveive Web3 Crypto Payments with DePay.

## Set up a wallet

To receive payments on any blockchain, you must have a wallet compatible with that particular blockchain.

DePay supports **all types of wallets**, whether it's a **"Hot Wallet"**, **"Cold Wallet"**, **ledger**, **custodial wallet**, centralized **exchange wallet**, or a **multisignature wallet**.
DePay streamlines the payment reception process directly to your wallet.

## Pick blockchains

Blockchains primarily vary in terms of **speed**, **usage** (including active users, tokens, and liquidity), and **security**.
We encourage you to conduct your own research and select at least one blockchain to configure DePay for payment reception.

## Select tokens

Once you've chosen the blockchains for payment reception, you must specify the **tokens you wish to accept**.
With DePay's **auto-conversion**, your users can pay using any token they hold, ensuring you receive only the tokens you've pre-selected or configured.
